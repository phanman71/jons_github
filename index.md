## Welcome to Jon's first GitHub Page

Hello World, and welcome to my first github page. I might seems pretty techie sometimes but I'm actually more of an artist... maybe about 65% artist 35% tech? I've only dabbled a little with code and actually haven't done web stuff since the old days of pasting themes into myspace boxes. 

So why am I making a website? Well I just started grad school and I've gotta make a blog for class and this is a coding class and I heard that github is a good place to share code so... why not figure out how to make a blog on github! I barely know how to use github besides the fact that I've been linked here before to download stuff. Well one of my strengths is being able to figure stuff out so here I am and here is the start to my blog!

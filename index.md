## Welcome to Jon's first GitHub Page

Hello World, and welcome to my first github page. I might seems pretty techie sometimes but I'm actually more of an artist... maybe about 65% artist 35% tech? I've only dabbled a little with code and actually haven't done web stuff since the old days of pasting themes into myspace boxes. 

So why am I making a website? Well I just started grad school and I've gotta make a blog for class and this is a coding class and I heard that github is a good place to share code so... why not figure out how to make a blog on github! I barely know how to use github besides the fact that I've been linked here before to download stuff. Well one of my strengths is being able to figure stuff out so here I am and here is the start to my blog!

### Creative Coding Week 1

During my first class in graduate school at NYU in the Intergrated Digital Media student I learned about p5js and how to use it for the first time. During the lecture and exploring the resources, I learned about 3D objects and how I had to use WEBGL, it was pretty cool, at the same time I also learned about animation in p5js. This is what I played around with and ended up with by the end of class:

For the first homework assignment I decided to go with the selfie. I figured that good starting point would be to sketch a selfie and figure out basic shapes to make myself. I then decided that it would make more sense to just take a real selfie to base it off of, leveraging what I know I decided to get a simple version of myself by running some photoshop filters.

//get curve vertex locations
function mousePressed() {
  console.log('curveVertex(' + mouseX + ',' + mouseY + ');');
